# Hi, I'm Anirban Khara 👋

I’m a **Full Stack Web Developer** who loves building **scalable applications** that work now—and later. Currently, I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science at **The George Washington University**, where I’m learning all the tricks to make software do what it’s supposed to. I’m skilled in **JavaScript, Python, and cloud tech** and enjoy creating straightforward solutions that don’t need a user manual the size of a dictionary.
