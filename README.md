# Hi, I'm Anirban Khara 👋

I’m a **Full Stack Web Developer** who builds **scalable applications** that work now—and later. Currently, I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science at **The George Washington University**, where I’m learning the skills to make software do what it’s supposed to, without the drama. I’m skilled in **JavaScript, Python, and cloud tech** and enjoy creating solutions that don’t need a user manual the size of a dictionary.
